This is a testing framework derived from UnitTest++ with these modifications:

  * Namespace renamed to follow this project's coding convention.

  * Replaced the CHECK macros with ASSERT macros which immediately abort the
    test on a failure. The rationale is to prevent failed tests from continuing
    to run and possibly corrupt memory by writing through an invalid pointer,
    thus causing subsequent tests to produce unreliable results or crash.
