C++ Hessian web service protocol request broker

This is a framework to implement a Hessian client in C++.  A code generator
examines type information from a Java interface to generate C++ code which can
call the methods of the interface.  In effect, Java is the interface definition
language for specifying the methods callable by clients.

The steps for building a distributed application with a Java server and C++
client are:

  * Create a Java interface defining methods to be called by clients.

  * Write a Java server which implements the Java interface and exposes it to
    clients using Hessian.

  * Generate code for a client-side C++ class which acts as a proxy for the
    server.  The proxy implements the interface methods by sending requests to
    the server.

  * Write a C++ client application which calls methods on the proxy.
